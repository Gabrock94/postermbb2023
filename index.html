<h1 class="text-center">Recordings of SEPs from spinal regions: a systematic review</h1> 
<h4 class="text-center">Gabrieli G., Leandri M., Iannetti G.D. </h4>

<p class="fs-2 mt-5">Non-invasive measuring of the electrical activity of the spinal cord would be highly desirable for both physiological and clinical reasons. 
  Despite the safety of intrathecal recording techniques, recordings of the activity of the spinal cord at the cutaneous level has several advantages:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>it can be more comfortably applied to human participants</li>
    <li>cutaneous level recordings are relatively easy to perform</li>
    <li>recordings at the skin level are cost effective, as they do not require specialized equipment or training</li>
  </ul> 

  <p>In spite of the fact that near-field scalp recordings of SEP have been reported to be less affected by movements' artifacts and muscles' activity, 
  thye do do not provide adequate spatial resolutions to identify the position of possible damages to the pathway, and have been reported as having extremely low sensitivity to detect partially preserved spinal cord function.</p>

  <p>Recording the electrical activity of the spinal cord using non-invasive techniques is however highly challengin because of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the small and not homogeneous transversal diameter of the spinal cord</li>
    <li>the non consistent depth of the spinal cord</li>
    <li>the possible lack of regular cellular arrangement that makes synaptic potentials summate</li>
    <li>the presence of  muscular movements that generate artifacts that are orders of magnitude larger than a neural signal of interest</li>
    <li>a massive artifact caused by the heart beat</li>
    <li>the overlap between the activity of the synaptci activity and of the afferent volleys in both the brachial plexus</li>
  </ul> 

  <p>There is a growing body of literature describing responses claimed to have originated in the spinal cord in response to transcutaneous stimulation of peripheral somatosensory afferents. However, there is a lack of consistency in the literature available at that time on spinal SEPs consequent to the multitude of recording setups which has become even more relevant now, given a large number of articles published in recent years years, yielding worryingly inconsistent results. Therefore an assessment of the available publications is necessary, as an attempt to understand if discrepancies in obtained signals can be explained in terms of differences in methods and analytic approaches.</p>

<h1 class="text-center">The current study</h1> 
<p class="fs-2 mt-5"> For these reasons, we conducted a systematic review of the literature on spinal SEPs consequent to transcutaneous stimulation of peripheral somatosensory afferents.</p>

<p>The systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement (Radua, 2021). 
  A computer-assisted search was conducted on Scopus (Burnham, 2006). Search terms included "spinal cord" and "recording". 
  Filters were applied to limit the results to articles published in peer-reviewed articles, at the final stage, written in English. 
  Results were limited in order to exclude experiments conducted on nonhuman models, retrospective studies, and theoretical studies.
  </p> 

  <h2 class="text-center">Inclusion criteria</h2>
  <p>In order to be included, articles hat to:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>be written in English</li>
    <li>be published in peer-reviewed journals</li>
    <li>describe recordings of SEP at the dermal or subdermal levels of non-cephalic areas along the spine</li>
    <li>describe recordings on human subjects </li>
    <li>contain sufficient details to understand the experimental procedure</li>

      <h1 class="text-center">Results, in brief</h1>
    <p> To sum up, our reccomendations are:
      <ol>
        <li>Use a non-cephalic reference (to avoid overlap between spinal and brain activity)</li>
        <li>use a high sampling rate (above 4000Hz, to indentify components close to each other in time)</li>
        <li>recording the ECG, in order to be able to better remove cardiac artifacts</li> 
        <li>use a setup that minimize participants' movements (e.g. supine or semisitting)</li>
        <li>use a high stimulation intensity (above 13mA)</li>
        <li>use a low stimulation frequency (and avoid factors of the power line)</li>
        <li>filters can affect latencies and amplitude of the components, use them wisely!</li>
        <li>use a high number of trials averaged (to account for intertrial variability and artifacts)</li>
